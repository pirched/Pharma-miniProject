Second Semester in first year and I'm knee deep in java after formatting most of what I learnt in Cpp over the short holiday, 
but anyway this was our project for this semester and I DID MY BEST even though the lecturer didn't even scrutinise my work like I was expecting. 
I mean, its not even funny when i spend so much time on a project Chat-GPTing everything and anything since the LECTURER did a bare minimum job in class 
and expects me to have a fully functional app, and then looks at the login page and one functionality then calls it a day 
like I just didn't spend the last 24 hours awake polishing on the little details to make it perfect.
Well, I'm not complaining since I really learnt a lot, but still send a memo or something next time...
